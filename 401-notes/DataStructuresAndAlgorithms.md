# Data Structures and Algorithms


## Discussion Questions

1. What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?

By using bigO notation to measure which data structure will have the best scaling and performance.

2. How can we ensure that weâ€™ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?

By having the two parts of a recursive function, a base case and a recursive case.

## Things I want to know more about

Whats a good website to practice algorithms and data structures.
