# Prep: Practice in the Terminal


The command line: Using the up and down arrow keys to acces the command line history

Navigation: Using tab to complete path names. Relative path (relative to where we are in the system) vs Absolute path ( a file or directory bath relation to the root of the system)

More about files: Linux is a extensionless system and case sensitive. Using quotes and escape character (\) to access files with spaces in their name.

Manual Pages: Using the command `man` you can look up the manual pages of commands
  
File Manipulation: Using `cp` to copy files, using `mv` to move and rename dir & files, and using `rm -r <directory>` to remove non empty directories
