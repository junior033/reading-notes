# Readings: Debugging


## What Went Wrong? Troubleshooting JavaScript.

1. Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error.
Syntax errors: These are spelling errors in your code that actually cause the program not to run at all, or stop working part way through
Logic errors: These are errors where the syntax is actually correct but the code is not what you intended it to be, meaning that program runs successfully but gives incorrect results. 

2. List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.

Syntax errors are very common errors that I come across. I'm learning that the best way to catch these is to try to take a step back and reread the code
with fresh eyes after taking a break.  Logic errors happen often as well and I've learned that in order to avoid making these type of mistakes is to
first try to break down the task or problem down to the smallest step and work up from there.

3. How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?

Catching your own errors is a part of the game. Learning how to curb them when they appear or even better not making them at all will always be something that as software developers have to strive to achieve.

## The JavaScript Debugger.

1. How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?

The JavaScript debugger allows you watch and understand what is going on within your code at each step of the way.

2. Define what a breakpoint is.

Breakpoints are places in your code that you want to pause execution and identify the problems that prevent your code from executing properly.

3. What is the call stack?

The Call stack section shows you what code was executed to get to the current line. You can see that the code is in the function that handles a mouse click, and that the code is currently paused on the breakpoint.
