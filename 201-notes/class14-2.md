## What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team

1. What are three key factors that contribute to psychologically safe teams?

Good communication, giving everyone an even amount of speaking time, having average social sensitivity and avoiding micromanaging.

2. Evaluate, with details, a previous professional setting (or team) you were in with regards to psychological safety.

In college, you are often put in groups to work together on projects so it is very common to have varying experiences. One example was when I was with a group
and the four of us had to collectively contribute to this finishing this project. It was suggested by our professor that we split responsibilities and roles so we did.
 We split the roles of the project so we each individually were responsible for a separate part of the project. Doing this caused things to be a little bit unbalanced
with the workload and communication. It led to one person mainly who took the larger role to act as the leader as spent most of the time communicating what we should do and how to do it.
As a result even though we passed and successfully completed the project it left a couple of us feeling a bit dissatisfied with the outcome in the project. It seems that separating
roles completely was not the best idea and that we should have worked together a little more on each part so we can feel more involved.

3. What impact do teams that operate with a high degree of psychological safety have on their company and the team members?

Being open and honest with who we are and our concerns is crucial to creating a psychologically safe space. We must be free to feel, think, and react openly without fear of
recriminations. It allows us to be more efficient by coming together as a whole to understand eachother emotionally.
