# Readings: Object-Oriented Programming, HTML Tables

## Domain Modeling

1. Explain why we need domain modeling.

Domain modeling is used to allow small conceptual models to be constructed to provide analysis of certain functionalities. It provides a meaningful
representation of real-world concepts that can be used to provide data analysis of the features.

## HTML Table Basics

1. Why should tables not be used for page layouts?

Layout tables reduce accessibility for visually impaired users.

2. List and describe 3 different semantic HTML elements used in an HTML `<table>`.

`tr`: stands for table row. It defines a row in a table. The subsequent `td` will be placed on the second row.

`td`: stands for table data and creates a small cell inside a table. 

`th`: stands for table header. Creates a cell at the start of a row or column and defines the type of data that it will contain.


## Introducing Constructors

1. What is a constructor and what are some advantages to using it?

It allows you to create more than one object that will contain the same properties.

2. How does the term `this` differ when used in an object literal versus when used in a constructor?



## Object Prototypes Using A Constructor

1. Explain prototypes and inheritance via an analogy from your previous work experience.
NOTE: This is a very common front end developer interview question

Prototypes allow your instanced constructor objects to inherit methods can be access by all future constructor object from the same constructor.
An example from my previous work experience of using prototype inheritance would be when a loan officer sends me a copy of his file that he wants me to 
work on while providing me permissions to use the same tools he has access to make changes to the file. I have a instanced copy of his file ( constructor object) and using prototype would allow me to access the same tools he has via permissions (prototype inheritance).

## Things I would like to know more about

Whats a good way to practice using prototypes and inhertances
