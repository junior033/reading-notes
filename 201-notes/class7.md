# Readings: Object-Oriented Programming, HTML Tables

## Domain Modeling

1. Explain why we need domain modeling.

Domain modeling is used to allow small conceptual models to be constructed to provide analysis of certain functionalities. It provides a meaningful
representation of real-world concepts that can be used to provide data analysis of the features.

## HTML Table Basics

1. Why should tables not be used for page layouts?

Layout tables reduce accessibility for visually impaired users.

2. List and describe 3 different semantic HTML elements used in an HTML `<table>`.

`tr`: stands for table row. It defines a row in a table. The subsequent `td` will be placed on the second row.
`td`: stands for table data and creates a small cell inside a table. 
`th`: stands for table header. Creates a cell at the start of a row or column and defines the type of data that it will contain.


## Introducing Constructors

1. What is a constructor and what are some advantages to using it?

It allows you to create more than one object that will contain the same properties.

2. How does the term `this` differ when used in an object literal versus when used in a constructor?



## Object Prototypes Using A Constructor

1. Explain prototypes and inheritance via an analogy from your previous work experience.
NOTE: This is a very common front end developer interview question



## Things I would like to know more about

Whats a good way to practice using prototypes and inhertances
