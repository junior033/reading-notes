# Readings: HTML Links, JS Functions, and Intro to CSS Layout

## Creating Hyperlinks

1. To create a basic link, we wrap text or other content inside what element?
A basic link is created by wrapping the text or other content, see Block level links, inside an `<a>` element.

2. The href attribute contains what information?
A Hypertext Reference, contains the web address.

3. What are some ways we can ensure links on our pages are accessible to all readers?
Three ways to make links more accessible are by keeping link text short, instances where multiple copies of the same text are linked to different places,
and not saying link.

## CSS Layout: Normal Flow CSS Layout: Positioning

1. What is meant by “normal flow”?
Normal Flow is the way that the webpage elements lay themselves out if the layout has not changed.

2. What are a few differences between block-level and inline elements?
A block level element's content fills the available inline space of the parent element containing it and grows along the block dimension to accommodate its content. The size of inline elements is just the size of their content. You can't set width or height on inline elements 

3. Static positioning is the default for every html element.

4. Name a few advantages to using absolute positioning on an element.
An absolutely positioned element no longer exists in the normal document flow. Instead, it sits on its own layer separate from everything else. This is very useful: it means that we can create isolated UI features that don't interfere with the layout of other elements on the page. For example, popup information boxes, control menus, rollover panels, UI features that can be dragged and dropped anywhere on the page, and so on.

5. What is a key difference between fixed positioning and absolute positioning?
Fixed positioning usually fixes an element in place relative to the visible portion of the viewport. 

## Functions – Reusable Blocks of Code

1. Describe the difference between a function declaration and a function invocation.
A function declaration is when a function is created and given a name. A function invocation is when the function is ran or used.

2. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?
Parameters are the place holder values that need to be used inside the function parantheses. Arguments are the value that are sent and used by the 
function.

### 6 Reasons for Pair Programming

1. Pick 2 benefits to pair programming and reflect on how these benefits could help you on your coding journey.
Working in pair programming provides a more engaged collaboration. By working with another you can bounce ideas of each other and further your progress in a more efficient manner. This provides a greater efficiency on the quality of code that is proceed. Although the process may seem longer it actually
reduces troubleshooting and debugging time in the back end since you may have worked most of those kinks out at the start of the process with your partner.
