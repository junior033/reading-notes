<sub>Reading Notes Journal</sub>

My name is Marlon Angulo. I live in Miami and i'm studying CS in FIU. This is where I will document my studies from my CodeFellows classes. I'm excited to create some projects, develop my portfolio, and continue my journey as a web developer.

**Growth mindset is having a open minded and optimistic perspective to challenges.**

3 reminders how to keep myself in a growth mindset:
  1. *Be patient*: Its important to allow time to practice and solidify learning. I will not always get it the first time but if i'm patient and persistent I will.
  2. *Dont lose sight on whats important*: Often times when encountering obstacles we can feel discouraged and lose focus. It's important to not lose sight on the challange ahead. No matter how big or small the obstacle dont forget its purpose and your own for being here.
  3. *Embracing the success of others*: It's easy to feel jealous or intimidated when your colleague is successful in areas you have not yet achieved. I often feel discouraged if I cannot grasp a concept as quickly or as well as someone else. I will share in their success and use it as a guide of insperation. I will share my passion and excitement for their accomplishments. For one day I will be in their shoes and wish to share my accomplishments and help others achieve the same.
