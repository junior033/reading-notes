# Programming with Javascript

Javascript is a unique programming language that provides interactivity to web pages on the browser. It is has built-in functions as
first class objects and is a dynamic language that allows for fast processing. Although primarily built for the front-end it has recently
been becoming more popular for back-end technologies.

## Control flow

Control flow is the order in which the computer reads and executes the code. It is read(run) beginning on the first line and continues
to the next line until it reaches the end. However, there are some exceptions. For example, when using conditional statements such as: 
if-else, loops, and events. These are conditional because it requires to meet a certain critirea to run and if it is not met then the
code never gets run and therefore does not execute.

## Expressions

An expression is a valid unit of code that resolves to a value. There are two types of expressions: those that have side effects 
(such as assigning values) and those that purely evaluate.

The expression `x = 7` is an example of the 1st type. This expression uses the = operator to assign the value seven to the variable x. 
The expression itself evaluates to 7.

The expression `3 + 4` is an example of the 2nd type. This expression uses the + operator to add 3 and 4 together and produces a value, 7

## Functions  

- A function in JavaScript is similar to a procedureâ€”a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value, but for a procedure
to qualify as a function, it should take some input and return an output where there is some obvious relationship between the input and the output.
In order to use a function it must be called upon and be defined within the scope you intend to use it.

- Function declarations must contain the keyword function before its name. You may pass parameters to the function when it is called.
``` 
square(2);

function square(number) {
  return number * number;
} 
```
