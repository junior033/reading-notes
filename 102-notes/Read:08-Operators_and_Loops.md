# Operators and Loops
Loops offer a quick and easy way to do something repeatedly. Javascript allows interations in the form of loops. Although there are 
many different type of loops but the mostly used ones are the `for` loop, `do..while` loop, and `while` loop. They can be combined
with operators to execute under certain conditions.

## Loops with Expressions
By adding expressions in a loop we can turn it into a conditional statement and assign values during that process. By adding an 
equal comparison operators we can check if two values are the equal before executing the loop `while (a == b)`. Assigning a value
in the declaration of the loop allows you to declare a new variable for use during the loops execution, `for (i = 0)`. We can also
add a conditional statement within the for loop `(for i = 0; i < 10)`. If the conditional expression passes the increment expression is
then executed, `(for i = 0; i < 10; i++);

## Things I want to know more about
- In what instance is it better to use a certain types of loops.
