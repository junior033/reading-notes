# Structure Web Pages with HTML

HTML is known as the backbone of the internet. It creates the structure of each webpage. In order to create the structure of a 
webpage there are a few things we want to know about first, the HTML language that is used to provide a layout of the page, the 
semantics or the meaning of the HTML code so we can effectively display the information, and finally, we need a wireframe that 
puts it all together in a design before we can actually get to work on the page.

## Wireframe

A wireframe is a design that is traditionally made by UX Designers in the company but it is good practice for any web developer
that wants to understand the importance of catering and defining a planned information hierarchy for their website. It's 
essentially a draft of how the webpage will look when fully developed. The way the information is laid out on the website 
will provide a unique experience to each user and it's important that we cater that experience to what we want to expect from
the user. Below are a few examples of wireframe tools:

- Wireframe.cc (featured in the video) - https://wireframe.cc/ 
- Adobe XD - https://www.adobe.com/products/xd.html

## HTML & Semantics

It's very important to understand the meaning behind each piece of code. The better we understand the code, the more effectively we can decide how we can render the webpage for the best user experience. HTML is composed of several tag elements. Each element has a different meaning and purpose, ie. `<h1> h1 is great to use for a top-level heading </h1>`. Conversely, if I want to add content to the bottom of the page I would use the `<footer> About Support Contacts </footer>`. Another common example is when we need to display large pieces of information. Traditionally as you would when writing an essay you would organize your material in several paragraphs HTML has a `<p></p>` that is used when it's necessary to structure such information on a webpage.
