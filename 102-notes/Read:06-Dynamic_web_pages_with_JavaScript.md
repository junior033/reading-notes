# Dynamic Web Pages with Javascript

HTML is the structure of the page and whereas CSS helps provides a styling, Javascript allows a web page to become dynamic. 
Javascript can be used for both front-end and back-end technologies. Whether its rendering a web page for a user or storing
information in the server, JS can manage both. 

## Javascript

Originally JS was used mainly in web browsers and was considered the language of the internet. As of recent it has been developed
to allow to run on server enviroments. It is a lightweight dynamic language that supports object-oriented functional 
programming. Javascript can add fuctionality to web pages through DOM and API manipulation. JS can be used inline HTML (written
inside the HTML element) or as an external file. It is traditionally best practice to use it externally.

## JS Cheat Sheet

**4 Ways to Declare a JavaScript Variable:**

- Using `var`: used primarily prior to 2015
- Using `let`: used if the value may change
- Using `const`: used if the value must stay constant

**Operators:**

- `=`: assigns value
- `+`:	Addition
- `-`:	Subtraction
- `*`:	Multiplication
- `**`:	Exponentiation
- `/`:	Division
- `%`:	Modulus (Division Remainder)
- `++`:	Increment
- `--`:	Decrement

**JavaScript Comparison Operators**

- `==`:	equal to
- `===`:	equal value and equal type
- `!=`:	not equal
- `!==`:	not equal value or not equal type
- `>`:	greater than
- `<`:	less than
- `>=`:	greater than or equal to
- `<=`:	less than or equal to

**JavaScript Logical Operators**

- `&&`:	logical and
- `||`:	logical or
- `!`:	logical not

**JavaScript Type Operators**

- `typeof`:	Returns the type of a variable
- `instanceof`:	Returns true if an object is an instance of an object type

**JavaScript Bitwise Operators**

Bit operators work on 32 bits numbers. Any numeric operand in the operation is converted into a 32 bit number. The result is converted back to a JavaScript number.
	
- `&`:	AND	
- `|`:	OR	
- `~`:	NOT
- `^`:	XOR	
- `<<`:	left shift	
- `>>`:	right shift	
- `>>>`	unsigned right shift
