# Dynamic Web Pages with Javascript

HTML is the structure of the page and whereas CSS helps provides a styling, Javascript allows a web page to become dynamic. 
Javascript can be used for both front-end and back-end technologies. Whether its rendering a web page for a user or storing
information in the server, JS can manage both. 

## Javascript

Originally JS was used mainly in web browsers and was considered the language of the internet. As of recent it has been developed
to allow to run on server enviroments. It is a lightweight dynamic language that supports object-oriented functional 
programming. Javascript can add fuctionality to web pages through DOM and API manipulation. JS can be used inline HTML (written
inside the HTML element) or as an external file. It is traditionally best practice to use it externally.
