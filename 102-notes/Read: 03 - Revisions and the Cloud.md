# Read: 03 - Revisions and the Cloud

When you are working there are several ways to record and save your progress. There is a lot of benefit to be able to look at previous versions of your work. Did you decide on a change in direction? Maybe, you noticed you started working off of bad information and need to backtrack. Or do you simply like to keep track of your progress? All of these things are possible with Git.

## What is Git ?

Git is a DVCS (Distributed Version Control System). It is a form of version control where you can keep track of various versions of your file by saving snapshots of it in a timeline. It saves and organizes different versions by the local version, centralized version, and distributed version. This allows multiple people to collaborate by allowing them to retrieve certain versions work on it themselves and make sure what they are working on is compatible with committing to the centralized version.

## Git Commands Cheat Sheet
git status: view unmerged files
git push origin main: pushes your committed local changes upstream for sharing
git add .: tracks the file you want to commit
git fetch: pulls new data to the local repository
