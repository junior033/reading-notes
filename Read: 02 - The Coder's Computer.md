# The Coder's Computer
  When someone begins their journey in software engineering at one point early into their journey they may ask themselves is:
How do I get one of those cool programs that all those cool hackers on TV use and which one is the best  for me? The truth is that
there are several resources out there for you to look into and it may be overwhelming at the start. 

## Terminal VS Text editor
  Often when you see someone coding on TV you will some some nerdy person typing lightning speed on the computer the screen scrolling words and
numbers in some strange alien language. Usually that scray and flashy screen is just a simple terminal that is used to access your computer files
and give commands to your operating system to complete certain tasks such as downloading a file in to a specific directory, `IE.sudo apt-get install <software name>`
or maybe something as simple as moving one file to another, IE. `mv example.txt ~/example_location`.


## The right text editor for you
  When you started you may have discovered that there are a lot of text editors you can use. However, the original question of
how do I select the best text editor for me? Might have turned into, which text editor uses the language I need to use and which features will
make it easier to complete my task or project. This is a good starting place where you can start to narrow down where to look for the right
text editor that will meet your requirements.


## Things I want to know
-Is it normal for people to use multiple different text editors?
  
-Why do some terminals are perfered for certain tasks over others, IE. Unix for web development?
