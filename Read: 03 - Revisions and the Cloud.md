   When you are working there are several ways to record and save your progress. There is a lot of benefit by being able to look at your previous versions of your work. Did you decide to have a change in direction? Maybe, you noticed you started working off of bad information and need to back track. Or do you simply like to keep track of your progress? All of these things are possible with Git.

## What is Git ?
   Git is a DVCS (Distrbuted Version Control System). It is a form of version control where you can keep track of various versions of your file by saving snapshots of it in a timeline. It saves and organizes different versions by the local version, centralized version and distrubed version. This allows multiple people to collaborate by allowing them to retrieve certain versions work on it themselves and making sure what they are working is compatible for committing to the ceneralized version.
