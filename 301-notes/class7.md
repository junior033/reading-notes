## How I explained REST to my brother

1. Who is Roy Fielding?

Roy Thomas Fielding is one of the principal authors of the HTTP specification and the originator of the Representational State Transfer architectural style. He is an authority on computer network architecture and co-founded the Apache HTTP Server project.

2. Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?

When Fielding and his colleagues started building the web, being able to talk to any machine anywhere in the world was a primary concern. But most of the techniques developers later used to get computers to talk to each other didn't have those requirements. 

3. What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?

Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-layer protocol for transmitting hypermedia documents, such as HTML. It was designed for communication between web browsers and web servers, but it can also be used for other purposes.

4. What does a GET do?

GET fetches a resource.

5. What does a POST do?

POST lets one system add something to another system.

6. What does PUT do?

PUT will replace something in another system.

7. What does PATCH do?

PATCH provides a partial update to another system.
