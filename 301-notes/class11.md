## nosql vs sql

Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:

	

| SQL           | NoSQL         | 
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
| Relational    | Distributed   |
|predefined schema | dynamic schema | 
|vertically scalable|horizontally scalable| 
|  structured query language |Unstructured Query Language| 
| table |      document   | 
 	 
 	 
 	 
1. What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?

Structured data

2. Give a real world example.

SQL is used in everyday life by some of the biggest companies like Netflix, Linkedin, Amazon, Flipkart, Instagram.

3. What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?

NoSQL database fits better for the hierarchical data storage as it follows the key-value pair way of storing data similar to JSON data. NoSQL database are highly preferred for large data set

4. Give a real world example.

Product catalogs 

5. Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?

NoSQL

6. Which type of database is best for scalability?

NoSQL

## sql vs nosql 

1. What does SQL stand for?

Structured Query Language

2. What is a relational database?

Relational database work with assubmtions and support SQL using tables

3. What type of structure does a relational database work with?

Structuring information in tables, rows, and columns.

4. What is a ‘schema’?

A database schema is a blueprint or architecture of how our data will look.

5. What is a NoSQL database?

NoSQL databases are non-tabular databases and store data differently than relational tables. NoSQL databases come in a variety of types based on their data model. The main types are document, key-value, wide-column, and graph. They provide flexible schemas and scale easily with large amounts of data and high user loads.

6. How does it work?

MongoDB stores data objects in collections and documents instead of the tables and rows used in traditional relational databases. Collections comprise sets of documents, which are equivalent to tables in a relational database.

7. What is inside of a MongoDB database?

MongoDB makes use of records which are made up of documents that contain a data structure composed of field and value pairs. Documents are the basic unit of data in MongoDB. 

8. Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.

MongoDB is more flexible because it has a felixible schema and uses horizontal scaling.

9. What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?

One of the most frequently cited drawbacks of NoSQL databases is that they don't support ACID (atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability) transactions across multiple documents.
